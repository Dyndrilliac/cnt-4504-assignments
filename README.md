This code makes use of my [Custom Java API](https://github.com/Dyndrilliac/java-custom-api). In order to build this source, you should clone the repository for the API using your Git client, then import the project into your IDE of choice (I prefer Eclipse), and finally modify the build path to include the API project. For more detailed instructions, see the README for the API project.

This repository contains all of the code that was written for the programming projects assigned in CNT 4504. Project 1 is a client/server pair using sockets. Project 2 is a client/server pair using RMI.
